# Rainwater Retention Project

## Description

This project provides a function to calculate the amount of rainwater that can be retained after a rainstorm, given a list of non-negative integers representing wall heights.

## Features

- Calculates the total amount of rainwater retained based on the wall heights.
- Handles cases where the ends of the wall list are not considered walls.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yusufmolumo/alu-interview.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alu-interview
   ```

3. Use the `rain` function by importing it in your Python code:

   ```python
   from alu-interview import rain

   walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
   result = rain(walls)
   print(f"Total rainwater retained: {result} square units")
   ```

4. Run your Python script and observe the result.

## Installation

No additional installation is required. Simply include the `rain.py` file in your project and import the `rain` function.
